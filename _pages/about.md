I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student at the **McGill University**'s [**Computer Science**](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) program with a minor in [Geographical Information Science](https://gic.geog.mcgill.ca/). Currently, I am supervised by Professor [**Raja Sengupta**](https://tomlinson.lab.mcgill.ca/Sengupta/index.html) (affiliations: GIScience, Spatial decision support systems, Agent-based modeling), working on **project website development** and **webmap data visualization** for possible migrations taken by nobles in early imperial China (Western Han period).

I have an intersted in frontend development and web data visualization, especially when associated with geospatial data.
