I am a 4th-year undergraduate student at the **McGill University**'s [Computer Science](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) program with a minor in [Geographical Information Science](https://gic.geog.mcgill.ca/). Currently, I am supervised by Professor [**Doina Precup**](https://mila.quebec/en/person/doina-precup/) (affiliations: Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, reasoning and planning under uncertainty), working on **model provenance risks in Vision Language Models** towards possible policy creation for model publications in the future.

In the past, I was supervised by Professor [**Raja Sengupta**](https://tomlinson.lab.mcgill.ca/Sengupta/index.html) (affiliations: GIScience, Spatial decision support systems, Agent-based modeling), working on **map digitization**, **webmap data visualization** for a historical geography prject about possible migrations taken by nobles in early imperial China (Western Han period). I also had 2 internships at [Bell Canada](https://www.bell.ca/) as a Data Scientist, where I've built ML solutions to business problems.

For this exciting upcoming year, I will be visiting the [PRADA (Provable Responsible AI and Data Analytics) Lab](https://pradalab1.github.io/opening.html) at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology ([KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/)) as a visiting student, and then the [Machine Learning and Data Science Unit](https://oist.mlds.jp/) at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology ([OIST](https://www.oist.jp/)) as a research intern.

Whether you are an incoming student to McGill or would like to chat in general, feel free to reach out to me via one of the contact information below.
