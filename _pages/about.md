I am a 4th-year undergraduate student at the **McGill University**'s [**Computer Science**](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) program with a minor in [Geographical Information Science](https://gic.geog.mcgill.ca/).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

If you are an incoming student at the McGill University or would like to chat in general, feel free to reach out to me via one of the contact information below.
