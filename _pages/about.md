I am a 4th-year undergraduate student at the **McGill University**'s [Computer Science](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) program with a minor in [Geographical Information Science](https://gic.geog.mcgill.ca/). Currently, I am supervised by Professor [**Doina Precup**](https://mila.quebec/en/person/doina-precup/) (affiliations: Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, reasoning and planning under uncertainty), working on **model provenance risks in Vision Language Models** towards possible policy creation for model publications in the future.

In the past, I was supervised by Professor [**Raja Sengupta**](https://tomlinson.lab.mcgill.ca/Sengupta/index.html) (affiliations: GIScience, Spatial decision support systems, Agent-based modeling), working on **map digitization**, **webmap data visualization** for possible migrations taken by nobles in early imperial China (Western Han period). I also had an internship at [Bell Canada](https://www.bell.ca/) as a Data Scientist, working on building ML solutions to business problems.
